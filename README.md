# AI Full Game

# AI-Generated Python Game Project

## Overview
This repository showcases a Python-based game entirely created using AI-generated code, developed under my supervision. The project utilizes AI-generated logic and UI elements to build an interactive game.

## Description
The game is a space-themed adventure where players control a spaceship to navigate through challenges and battles. The entire game's logic, including spaceship movement, enemy behavior, and UI elements, is designed using AI-generated code.

## GOAL: 
- Spaceship movement controlled via arrow keys
- AI-generated enemy behavior and interactions
- AI-designed UI elements for a visually appealing game interface
- Laser firing mechanism with AI-generated logic

## Contributions
Contributions to enhance gameplay mechanics, improve AI-generated elements, or add new features are welcome. Please refer to the contribution guidelines for more details.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pygame library
- [Any additional libraries or tools required to run the project]
